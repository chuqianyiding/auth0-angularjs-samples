# Auth0 AngularJS Authorization

This sample demonstrates how to include user authorization in an AngularJS application with Auth0.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box. If you are using the server provided in this sample, that URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

Clone the repo or download it from the AngularJS quickstart page in Auth0's documentation. Install the dependencies for the app.

```bash
cd 04-Calling-an-API
npm install
```

## Set the Client ID and Domain, and Audience

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.js.example` file to `auth0-variables.js` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there.

You should also provide the identifier for the API you create in the Auth0 dashboard as your `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`. Authorization is carried out using `scope`s which can be set using the `REQUESTED_SCOPES` variable.

## Set Up the `.env` File

In addition to the above-mentioned `auth0-variables.js` file, a `.env` file is provided at the root of the application. This file provides your application's credentials to the small Node server located in `server.js`.

This file has two values, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` and `AUTH0_DOMAIN`. If you download this sample from the quickstart page, the value for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` will be populated automatically, but you will still need to populate `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` manually. The value for `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is the identifier used for an API that you create in the Auth0 dashboard.

## Run the Application

A small express server is used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Turning Off HTML5 Mode

By default, the sample is run in HTML5 mode. This means that routes in the URL will not have a hash. If you wish to not use HTML5 mode, comment on this line in `app.js`:

```js
$locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account
